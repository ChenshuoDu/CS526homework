Preorder (root, left, right): A B E H F I C D G(First visit A ​​(the root), then the entire subtree of B (E-H-F-I), then visit C, and finally D-G.)
Breadth-first: A B C D E F G H I(Visit layer by layer. First layer A - Second layer B, C, D - Third layer E, F, G - Fourth layer H, I.)
Postorder (left, right, root): H E I F B C G D A(First visit all child nodes (H, E, I, F, B, C, G, D) and finally visit the root node A.)
In-order traversal sequence: G, D, B, E, A, C, H, F, I
(Starting from the root node A, first walk left to B.
From B, walk left to D.
From D, walk left to G. G has no children - Visit G.
Return to D - Visit D.
Return to B, complete the left subtree - Visit B.
Then visit B's right subtree E - Visit E.
Return to the root node A - Visit A.
Then visit the right subtree C.
C has no child to its left - Go right to F.
F has H to its left - Visit H.
Return to F - Visit F.
Go right to I - Visit I.)
