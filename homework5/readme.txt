There are three small programs in this homework. Each question has its own
folder (q1, q2, q3). Just go into the folder you want to run.

Q1 – Binary Search Tree
In this part I wrote a simple BST. It can insert, delete, search, and print
the tree. The program builds a tree first, does a few operations, and shows
the tree before and after.

How to run:
cd q1
python q1.py

Q2 – Morse Code Vowel Count
This program reads one line of Morse code (dots and dashes), converts each
symbol into a letter, and counts how many of them are vowels. The input file
only needs one line.

How to run:
cd q2
python q2.py vowel_input1.txt

Q3 – Longest Alternating Increasing Sequence
Here the program takes two integer sequences A and B. The goal is to build
a sequence that switches between A and B while the numbers keep increasing.
I try both starting choices (start from A or start from B) and pick whichever
gives the longer result.

How to run:
cd q3
python q3.py longest_seq1.txt


All three programs run directly in the terminal.  
No extra libraries are needed, and the output shows up right away.
