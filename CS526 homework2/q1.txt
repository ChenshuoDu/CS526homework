The advantage of the tail pointer is that you can directly access the last node of the linked list without having to traverse the entire linked list from the beginning.
A tail pointer allows direct access to the last node in the list.
Without it, inserting at the end requires O(n) traversal.
With it, insertion at the end is O(1).
Especially useful in queues or when frequent insertions at the end are required.
Conclusion: Improves efficiency by enabling constant-time insertion at the end of the list.
